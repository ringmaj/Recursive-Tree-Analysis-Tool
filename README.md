**Recursive Tree Analysis Tool**###



A personal project I am working on to simplify the analysis of recursive trees by the recursion tree method using OpenGl/C++. This tool allows users to follow a simple graphical user interface to input a recursive equation such as T(n) = 4T(n/2) + 2n2 and view the output as a detailed recursive tree. Users are also able to view other details such as depth, size of sub-problem, number of nodes, workload per node, and total workload per depth. In this project, only OpenGl primitives were used.
